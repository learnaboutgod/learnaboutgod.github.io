  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: -13.01px;">We all face times that threaten to crush the life out of us, don&#8217;t we? Maybe you&#8217;re in one of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 3.47px;">those times right now, where you&#8217;ve lost someone dear, or had something precious unjustly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 19.95px;">taken from you. Maybe you&#8217;ve just received devastating news from the doctor, or had your </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 36.42px;">world smashed to pieces by betrayal or rape. In your pain, in your frustration, in your anger, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 52.9px;">you may have asked, &#8220;God, if You are good, how could You allow this? Why didn&#8217;t You stop it? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 69.37px;">Do You really care about me? Really, do You?&#8221; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 102.33px;">And the answer is: God does care. He cares with His whole heart. He made you. You are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 118.8px;">precious to Him. How could He not care? Jesus, God Himself, shares how He feels in His heart: </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 135.28px;">&#8220;Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 151.75px;">the will of your Father. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don&#8217;t be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s1" style="top: 168.23px;"><span class="xr_s0" style="">afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.&#8221; </span><span class="xr_s2" style="">(Matthew 10:29-31, The Bible, NIV) </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 201.18px;">But, since God does care about us, since He is good, why then do bad things happen to us?</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 234.13px;">The next four paragraphs take us back to what happened when God created man and woman, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 250.61px;">because it is a key to understanding why bad things happen to us, even though God is good.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 283.56px;">The Good Life God Gave Us</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 300.04px;">When God created Adam and Eve, He made an unbelievably wonderful place for them to live, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 316.51px;">the Garden of Eden. Everything about this paradise was breathtakingly beautiful: the colors, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 332.99px;">the sounds, the scents, all of it. Even their tastebuds danced with life as they ate fruit that was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 349.47px;">so mouthwateringly scrumptious. <span class="xr_s10" style="">Best of all, there was relational harmony between them, and </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 365.94px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">between them and God.</span>&nbsp;God made this amazing home for them because He loved them with </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 382.42px;">His whole heart. Now, in the middle of this garden, God had planted two very special trees: the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 398.89px;">Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. And God let them know they were </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 415.37px;">free to eat from any tree of the garden, but from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 431.85px;">must not eat, because if they did, they would change, the world would change, and the nature </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 448.32px;">of their relationship with Him would change-- they would surely die. All that had been created </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 464.8px;">by God to only experience life, would instead experience death. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 497.75px;">God Gave Us the Ability to Choose So Our Love Could be Real</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 514.23px;">But, why would God put this tree in the garden if eating its fruit was so deadly? <span class="xr_s10" style="">One reason is </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 530.7px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">because God wanted to give Adam and Eve a very precious gift: the ability to choose.</span>&nbsp;Love is a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 547.18px;">choice. In one sense, love is only love if you can choose to give it. God didn&#8217;t want them to be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 563.65px;">with Him because they had no other choice. He wanted them to be with Him because they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 580.13px;">wanted to. A real love relationship is where love is willingly given, not forced or taken. So the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 596.61px;">Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil being in the garden was a way for them to choose if they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 613.08px;">wanted to be with God (by not eating this fruit), or choose to be apart from God (by eating this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 629.56px;">fruit). And, for them to have a real ability to choose, God would honor whatever decision they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 646.03px;">made. The ability to choose wasn&#8217;t a sham, where, the moment they decided to eat the fruit, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 662.51px;">God stopped them and said, &#8220;Ha! I know you wanted to eat this fruit, but you don&#8217;t really have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 678.99px;">a choice!&#8221; No, their ability to choose was genuine. God would respect their choice: even if they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 695.46px;">chose to reject Him and His ways, even if the risk of death entering our world was grave. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 728.41px;">The Jeopardy in Choice: The Potential that Death Becomes Our Reality</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 744.89px;">Now, why did eating this fruit have to lead to death? Why couldn&#8217;t it have led to life? Was God </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 761.37px;">being vindictive, or trying to unfairly steer their decision, by attaching an extreme consequence </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 777.84px;">(death) to the choice of eating this fruit (rejecting Him)? No, not at all. When God told them </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 794.32px;">the outcome of eating the fruit was death, He was simply stating a fact. You see, God is life, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 810.79px;">and the very source of life. (In Him is joy, kindness, and all that is good. God is the essence of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 827.27px;">love itself.) <span class="xr_s10" style="">If Adam and Eve ate the fruit, they would be separated from all this because they </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 843.75px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">would be separated from God: this is what death is.</span>&nbsp;Where there had been only joy, now there </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 860.22px;">would be grief and suffering. Where there had been only love, now there would be hate and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 876.7px;">loneliness. Where there had been only a deep knowing of one another, now there would be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 893.17px;">misunderstanding and mistrust. Death isn&#8217;t just physical; it&#8217;s relational, emotional, and spiritual, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 909.65px;">too. Death is separation from God, and all that is of good and life. God wasn&#8217;t being vindictive, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 926.13px;">He was just trying to tell them the ugly reality that would result if they ate this fruit.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 959.08px;">Adam and Eve Choose</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 975.55px;">Sadly, after being tempted by the devil, Adam and Eve chose to sin by rejecting God and eating </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 992.03px;">from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. In that instant, death entered. Relational </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1008.51px;">breakage between us and God, and us and each other, entered. They now &#8220;knew&#8221; the horrific </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1024.98px;">reality of what separation from God was like. And things that were not supposed to be, became </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1041.46px;">our reality. <span class="xr_s10" style="">Cancer, murder, decay, and natural disaster-- things we were not meant to </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1057.93px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">experience-- swept in to become the anguished normal of our lives, as did betrayal, abuse, </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1074.41px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">hate, exploitation and so much else that is of death.</span>&nbsp;At that moment, our world was perverted, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s11" style="top: 1090.89px;"><span class="xr_s0" style="">as were our desires, thoughts, and motives. </span><span class="xr_s0" style="">When God made Adam and Eve, He had endowed </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1107.36px;">them with phenomenal intelligence and wisdom, but now they had gained extra &#8220;knowledge&#8221;-- </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s11" style="top: 1123.84px;"><span class="xr_s0" style="">knowledge, though, that wasn&#8217;t at all what they thought it&#8217;d be. T</span><span class="xr_s0" style="">hey had &#8220;known&#8221; what good </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1140.31px;">was, by experience; now they &#8220;knew,&#8221; by experience, what evil was, too. Did God want it to be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1156.79px;">this way? No. That&#8217;s why, in love, He tried to warn them. But, in the end, it was their choice.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1189.74px;"><span class="xr_s9" style="">All That Once was Pristine and Good has been Corrupted by Death</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1206.22px;">Why, then, do bad things happen to us? Is it because God isn&#8217;t good or doesn&#8217;t care about us? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1222.69px;">No. It&#8217;s because God gave Adam and Eve the ability to choose. And for them to have an honest </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1239.17px;">ability to choose, God decided that, as difficult as it would be, He would respect their choice, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1255.65px;">even if their choice led to death. We now live the aftermath of Adam and Eve&#8217;s decision, just as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1272.12px;">children are impacted by the choices their parents make. As a result, natural disasters, disease, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1288.6px;">and famine have become our reality. Yet, God didn&#8217;t just give them the ability to choose. He </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1305.07px;">gave us the ability to choose, as well; and, just like them, God respects our choice. You may </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1321.55px;">have had your life torn to bits because someone chose to drink and drive. Someone may have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1338.03px;">chosen to build houses in an area prone to flooding, leading to a catastrophic loss of life when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1354.5px;">the rains came. Someone may have chosen to betray you, take advantage of you, or spread </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1370.98px;">lies about you, leaving your life in shambles. These are terrible, terrible things, and we need to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1387.45px;">be clear-- for our sake, God&#8217;s sake, and the sake of our relationship with God-- <span class="xr_s10" style="">God didn&#8217;t </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1403.93px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">cause these bad things to happen to you or me; these are the result of people&#8217;s choices.</span>* </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1436.88px;">We live in a world that is broken in so many ways, not just from the choice of our first parents, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1453.36px;">but from the freewill choices of so many others, too. Sin is when we choose to turn from God </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1469.83px;">and His ways-- when we choose to not love God and those around us-- and death is the result. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1486.31px;">We do not need to read the headlines to know it has not gone well for us. God looks at the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1502.79px;">terrible mess our world is in, at all that has been wrought by selfish act upon selfish act, sin </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1519.26px;">upon sin, bad choice upon bad choice. He sees the millions plunged into chaos and dislocation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1535.74px;">from war, the countless crushed by greed and injustice, the weak abused over and again by </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1552.21px;">those in power, and all those left in the turbulent wake of genocide and corruption, grasping at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1568.69px;">the tattered pieces of their lives and dreams. And He just weeps. It didn&#8217;t have to be this way. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1585.17px;">Yet, God weeps over us not only because of the immense agony and suffering we experience </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1601.64px;">and have brought upon ourselves, but because of the fullness of death yet to come. You see, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1618.12px;">for a time, vestiges of God&#8217;s goodness are still with us-- we can still love, laugh, feel joy-- but </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1634.59px;">one day, and for all eternity after, every aspect of God and His goodness will be gone. No love.&nbsp; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1651.07px;">No happiness. No peace. Only inescapable loneliness, unrelenting hopelessness, gnawing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1667.55px;">emptiness, and an absence of all that is good. This is eternal death, and it is the consequence </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1684.02px;">not only of Adam and Eve&#8217;s sin, but of our own, as well. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1716.97px;">Is all hope lost then? Though God cares about us, has He left us to our own devices? Is eternal </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1733.45px;">suffering-- eternal death-- our inevitable destiny because of the choices we have made? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1749.93px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1766.4px;">No, there is yet a way.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1799.35px;"><span class="xr_s9" style="">There is Hope</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1815.83px;">Because God is good, because He cares about us so much, He did something incredible so the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1832.31px;">worst possible thing that will happen to us does not have to be our destiny. At the greatest cost </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1848.78px;">to Himself, God made a way so our destiny could be one of eternal life instead of eternal death. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1865.26px;">And that way is Jesus. When we accept what Jesus did by dying on the cross to pay for our sin </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1881.73px;">stained lives, we experience a new beginning, a new life, a new peace and joy that can begin </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1898.21px;">to transcend even the worst struggles we&#8217;ll face in this lifetime. Because of what Jesus did, we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1914.69px;">can have a renewed relationship with God! This new life won&#8217;t be fully experienced until we are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1931.16px;">in heaven, but even now we can begin to experience the satisfaction of our deepest longing-- </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1947.64px;">to connect with the most lovely being of all, God Himself. Jesus died so you could choose </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1964.11px;">whether you wanted to be in relationship with God. But, only you can make that choice. Click </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1980.59px;">on the videos on the homepage to see how you can be restored in your relationship with God. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2013.54px;">*&#8221;But, what about justice? What about fairness? Does God just let bad people get away with </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2030.02px;">murder and all manner of evil?&#8221; you may ask. This is a great question we cover elsewhere due </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2046.49px;">to the length of this current Q + A. Suffice it to say for now, <a href="god%20is%20just.htm" onclick="return(xr_nn());" onmousemove="xr_mo(this,44)" >God is just</a>. He hates injustice. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2062.97px;">God detests oppression, and a day of final, fair justice is coming. God promises it.</span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: -13.01px;">We all face times that threaten to crush the life out of us, don&#8217;t we? Maybe </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 3.47px;">you&#8217;re in one of those times right now, where you&#8217;ve lost someone dear, or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 19.95px;">had something precious unjustly taken from you. Maybe you&#8217;ve just received </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 36.42px;">devastating news from the doctor, or had your world smashed to pieces by </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 52.9px;">betrayal or rape. In your pain, in your frustration, in your anger, you may have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 69.37px;">asked, &#8220;God, if You are good, how could You allow this? Why didn&#8217;t You stop </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 85.85px;">it? Do You really care about me? Really, do You?&#8221; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 118.8px;">And the answer is: God does care. He cares with His whole heart. He made </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 135.28px;">you. You are precious to Him. How could He not care? Jesus, God Himself, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 151.75px;">shares how He feels in His heart: &#8220;Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 168.23px;">not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. And </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 184.71px;">even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don&#8217;t be afraid; you are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s1" style="top: 201.18px;"><span class="xr_s0" style="">worth more than many sparrows.&#8221; </span><span class="xr_s2" style="">(Matthew 10:29-31, The Bible, NIV) </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 234.13px;">But, since God does care about us, since He is good, why then do bad things </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 250.61px;">happen to us?</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 283.56px;">The next four paragraphs take us back to what happened when God created </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 300.04px;">man and woman, because it is a key to understanding why bad things happen </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 316.51px;">to us, even though God is good.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 349.47px;">The Good Life God Gave Us</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 365.94px;">When God created Adam and Eve, He made an unbelievably wonderful place </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 382.42px;">for them to live, the Garden of Eden. Everything about this paradise was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 398.89px;">breathtakingly beautiful: the colors, the sounds, the scents, all of it. Even their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 415.37px;">tastebuds danced with life as they ate fruit that was so mouthwateringly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 431.85px;">scrumptious. <span class="xr_s10" style="">Best of all, there was relational harmony between them, and </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 448.32px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">between them and God.</span>&nbsp;God made this amazing home for them because He </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 464.8px;">loved them with His whole heart. Now, in the middle of this garden, God had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 481.27px;">planted two very special trees: the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 497.75px;">Good and Evil. And God let them know they were free to eat from any tree of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 514.23px;">the garden, but from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil they must not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 530.7px;">eat, because if they did, they would change, the world would change, and the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 547.18px;">nature of their relationship with Him would change-- they would surely die. All </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 563.65px;">that had been created by God to only experience life, would instead </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 580.13px;">experience death. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 613.08px;">God Gave Us the Ability to Choose So Our Love Could be Real</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 629.56px;">But, why would God put this tree in the garden if eating its fruit was so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 646.03px;">deadly? <span class="xr_s10" style="">One reason is because God wanted to give Adam and Eve a very </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 662.51px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">precious gift: the ability to choose.</span>&nbsp;Love is a choice. In one sense, love is only </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 678.99px;">love if you can choose to give it. God didn&#8217;t want them to be with Him </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 695.46px;">because they had no other choice. He wanted them to be with Him because </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 711.94px;">they wanted to. A real love relationship is where love is willingly given, not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 728.41px;">forced or taken. So the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil being in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 744.89px;">garden was a way for them to choose if they wanted to be with God (by not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 761.37px;">eating this fruit), or choose to be apart from God (by eating this fruit). And, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 777.84px;">for them to have a real ability to choose, God would honor whatever decision </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 794.32px;">they made. The ability to choose wasn&#8217;t a sham, where, the moment they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 810.79px;">decided to eat the fruit, God stopped them and said, &#8220;Ha! I know you wanted </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 827.27px;">to eat this fruit, but you don&#8217;t really have a choice!&#8221; No, their ability to choose </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 843.75px;">was genuine. God would respect their choice: even if they chose to reject Him </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 860.22px;">and His ways, even if the risk of death entering our world was grave. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 893.17px;">The Jeopardy in Choice: The Potential that Death Becomes Our </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 909.65px;">Reality</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 926.13px;">Now, why did eating this fruit have to lead to death? Why couldn&#8217;t it have led </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 942.6px;">to life? Was God being vindictive, or trying to unfairly steer their decision, by </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 959.08px;">attaching an extreme consequence (death) to the choice of eating this fruit </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 975.55px;">(rejecting Him)? No, not at all. When God told them the outcome of eating the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 992.03px;">fruit was death, He was simply stating a fact. You see, God is life, and the very </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1008.51px;">source of life. (In Him is joy, kindness, and all that is good. God is the essence </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1024.98px;">of love itself.) <span class="xr_s10" style="">If Adam and Eve ate the fruit, they would be separated from all </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1041.46px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">this because they would be separated from God: this is what death is.</span>&nbsp;Where </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1057.93px;">there had been only joy, now there would be grief and suffering. Where there </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1074.41px;">had been only love, now there would be hate and loneliness. Where there had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1090.89px;">been only a deep knowing of one another, now there would be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1107.36px;">misunderstanding and mistrust. Death isn&#8217;t just physical; it&#8217;s relational, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1123.84px;">emotional, and spiritual, too. Death is separation from God, and all that is of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1140.31px;">good and life. God wasn&#8217;t being vindictive, He was just trying to tell them the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1156.79px;">ugly reality that would result if they ate this fruit.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s9" style="top: 1189.74px;">Adam and Eve Choose</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1206.22px;">Sadly, after being tempted by the devil, Adam and Eve chose to sin by </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1222.69px;">rejecting God and eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. In that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1239.17px;">instant, death entered. Relational breakage between us and God, and us and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1255.65px;">each other, entered. They now &#8220;knew&#8221; the horrific reality of what separation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1272.12px;">from God was like. And things that were not supposed to be, became our </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1288.6px;">reality. <span class="xr_s10" style="">Cancer, murder, decay, and natural disaster-- things we were not meant </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1305.07px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">to experience-- swept in to become the anguished normal of our lives, as did </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1321.55px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">betrayal, abuse, hate, exploitation and so much else that is of death.</span>&nbsp;At that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1338.03px;">moment, our world was perverted, as were our desires, thoughts, and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s11" style="top: 1354.5px;"><span class="xr_s0" style="">motives. </span><span class="xr_s0" style="">When God made Adam and Eve, He had endowed them with </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1370.98px;">phenomenal intelligence and wisdom, but now they had gained extra </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1387.45px;">&#8220;knowledge&#8221;-- knowledge, though, that wasn&#8217;t at all what they thought it&#8217;d be. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s11" style="top: 1403.93px;"><span class="xr_s0" style="">T</span><span class="xr_s0" style="">hey had &#8220;known&#8221; what good was, by experience; now they &#8220;knew,&#8221; by </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1420.41px;">experience, what evil was, too. Did God want it to be this way? No. That&#8217;s </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1436.88px;">why, in love, He tried to warn them. But, in the end, it was their choice.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1469.83px;"><span class="xr_s9" style="">All That Once was Pristine and Good has been Corrupted by Death</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1486.31px;">Why, then, do bad things happen to us? Is it because God isn&#8217;t good or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1502.79px;">doesn&#8217;t care about us? No. It&#8217;s because God gave Adam and Eve the ability to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1519.26px;">choose. And for them to have an honest ability to choose, God decided that, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1535.74px;">as difficult as it would be, He would respect their choice, even if their choice </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1552.21px;">led to death. We now live the aftermath of Adam and Eve&#8217;s decision, just as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1568.69px;">children are impacted by the choices their parents make. As a result, natural </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1585.17px;">disasters, disease, and famine have become our reality. Yet, God didn&#8217;t just </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1601.64px;">give them the ability to choose. He gave us the ability to choose, as well; and, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1618.12px;">just like them, God respects our choice. You may have had your life torn to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1634.59px;">bits because someone chose to drink and drive. Someone may have chosen to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1651.07px;">build houses in an area prone to flooding, leading to a catastrophic loss of life </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1667.55px;">when the rains came. Someone may have chosen to betray you, take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1684.02px;">advantage of you, or spread lies about you, leaving your life in shambles. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1700.5px;">These are terrible, terrible things, and we need to be clear-- for our sake, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1716.97px;">God&#8217;s sake, and the sake of our relationship with God-- <span class="xr_s10" style="">God didn&#8217;t cause these </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1733.45px;"><span class="xr_s10" style="">bad things to happen to you or me; these are the result of people&#8217;s choices.</span>* </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1766.4px;">We live in a world that is broken in so many ways, not just from the choice of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1782.88px;">our first parents, but from the freewill choices of so many others, too. Sin is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1799.35px;">when we choose to turn from God and His ways-- when we choose to not love </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1815.83px;">God and those around us-- and death is the result. We do not need to read </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1832.31px;">the headlines to know it has not gone well for us. God looks at the terrible </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1848.78px;">mess our world is in, at all that has been wrought by selfish act upon selfish </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1865.26px;">act, sin upon sin, bad choice upon bad choice. He sees the millions plunged </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1881.73px;">into chaos and dislocation from war, the countless crushed by greed and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1898.21px;">injustice, the weak abused over and again by those in power, and all those left </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1914.69px;">in the turbulent wake of genocide and corruption, grasping at the tattered </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1931.16px;">pieces of their lives and dreams. And He just weeps. It didn&#8217;t have to be this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1947.64px;">way. Yet, God weeps over us not only because of the immense agony and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1964.11px;">suffering we experience and have brought upon ourselves, but because of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1980.59px;">fullness of death yet to come. You see, for a time, vestiges of God&#8217;s goodness </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 1997.07px;">are still with us-- we can still love, laugh, feel joy-- but one day, and for all </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2013.54px;">eternity after, every aspect of God and His goodness will be gone. No love.&nbsp; No </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2030.02px;">happiness. No peace. Only inescapable loneliness, unrelenting hopelessness, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2046.49px;">gnawing emptiness, and an absence of all that is good. This is eternal death, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2062.97px;">and it is the consequence not only of Adam and Eve&#8217;s sin, but of our own, as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2079.45px;">well. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2112.4px;">Is all hope lost then? Though God cares about us, has He left us to our own </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2128.87px;">devices? Is eternal suffering-- eternal death-- our inevitable destiny because of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2145.35px;">the choices we have made? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2161.83px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2178.3px;">No, there is yet a way.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2211.25px;"><span class="xr_s9" style="">There is Hope</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2227.73px;">Because God is good, because He cares about us so much, He did something </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2244.21px;">incredible so the worst possible thing that will happen to us does not have to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2260.68px;">be our destiny. At the greatest cost to Himself, God made a way so our destiny </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2277.16px;">could be one of eternal life instead of eternal death. And that way is Jesus. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2293.63px;">When we accept what Jesus did by dying on the cross to pay for our sin </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2310.11px;">stained lives, we experience a new beginning, a new life, a new peace and joy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2326.59px;">that can begin to transcend even the worst struggles we&#8217;ll face in this lifetime. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2343.06px;">Because of what Jesus did, we can have a renewed relationship with God! This </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2359.54px;">new life won&#8217;t be fully experienced until we are in heaven, but even now we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2376.01px;">can begin to experience the satisfaction of our deepest longing-- to connect </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2392.49px;">with the most lovely being of all, God Himself. Jesus died so you could choose </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2408.97px;">whether you wanted to be in relationship with God. But, only you can make </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2425.44px;">that choice. Click on the videos on the homepage to see how you can be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2441.92px;">restored in your relationship with God. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2474.87px;">*&#8221;But, what about justice? What about fairness? Does God just let bad people </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2491.35px;">get away with murder and all manner of evil?&#8221; you may ask. This is a great </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2507.82px;">question we cover elsewhere due to the length of this current Q + A. Suffice it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2524.3px;">to say for now, <a href="god%20is%20just.htm" onclick="return(xr_nn());" onmousemove="xr_mo(this,52)" >God is just</a>. He hates injustice. God detests oppression, and a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s0" style="top: 2540.77px;">day of final, fair justice is coming. God promises it.</span>
